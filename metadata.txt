about=This plugin loads a Microsoft Access table for use iun QGIS. The underlying "pseudo mdb provider" simulates a data provider using a memory layer. This concept is copied from the Pseudo CSV Provider which can be found here: http://github.com/g-sherman/pseudo_csv_provider The concept is the same, the actual implementation is different. Like the original, the provider will: * Create a memory layer from a table in a MDB file * Create fields in the layer based on the different datatype found in the table * Write changes back to the database table using the primary keys (experimental) * Does not support geometries, but can easily linked to another layer A few things about this implementation: * It is an example, not a robust implementation * It lacks proper error handling * It could be extended to support geometry types
